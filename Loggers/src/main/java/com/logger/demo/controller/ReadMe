LogLevel typically refers to an enumeration (enum) that defines the various levels of logging severity.
These levels help categorize log messages based on their importance or severity, allowing developers and system administrators
to control the verbosity of logs and filter relevant information during troubleshooting and monitoring.

LEVELS ARE _
INFO
WARN
TRACE
DEBUG
ERROR


  // We can use LoggingSystem to set our loglevel at runtime:
      /*
      Allows for changing the logging levels of specific loggers at runtime,
       which is particularly useful for debugging production issues without restarting the application.

       loggingSystem.setLogLevel("com.example.service", LogLevel.TRACE);
       */
